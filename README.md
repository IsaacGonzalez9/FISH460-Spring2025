# Project Synopsis

As oceans heat up and climate extremes become more common, commercially valuable species face elevated risks. This was observed when the Bering Sea snow crab population collapsed, likely due to anthropogenic climate change. Scientists are unsure if the elevated temperatures in the Bering Sea caused the collapse due to their effects on range, predator-prey relationships, metabolism/starvation, disease, or a combination of factors.

In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of warming waters on disease prevention in Hemigrapsus oregonensis. H. oregonensis will be used as a proxy for the commercially important Dungeness crab (Cancer magister). To test this, three tanks with six specimens each were exposed to the following conditions: pathogens and elevated temperatures of 27째C; pathogens and 13째C; and no pathogens with 27째C. There was also a control tank maintained at 13째C. Pathogens were introduced through mud samples collected from H. oregonensis' natural habitat.

Responses will be analyzed using hemocyte counts, resazurin assays, righting time, and glucose levels. Week 1 results showed an increase in hemocytes in the tank with pathogens and elevated temperatures, suggesting an immune response, followed by a decrease in week 2, possibly due to immune suppression. Resazurin assays showed that oxygen consumption was lowest in the mud+pathogen treatment group. Righting time was also longest for the mud+pathogen group, indicating higher levels of physiological stress.

Overall, the results point to the concern that rising temperatures may result in crabs in Washington State waters becoming more susceptible to disease, potentially harming commercial markets.
